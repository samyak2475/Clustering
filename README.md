1. Project Overview

Businesses need to understand their customers to make:

✔ Better marketing decisions
✔ Personalized recommendations
✔ Improved retention strategies
✔ Targeted promotions

This project uses unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to group customers into distinct segments based on shopping behavior.

These segments allow businesses to answer questions like:

Who are high-value customers?

Which customers buy frequently but spend less?

Which users are close to churn (inactive)?

Who prefers web purchases vs store purchases?
